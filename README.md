### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Enzo Dimitri, a student of Information Systems at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP)
- I have a huge interest in Linux and how things work
- I'm learning about php and Laravel, and I am planning to get started with React and node
- I don't use much social media, so my facebook and instagram pages are pretty much stagnated
- A social media that I use? Lemmy. I'm also trying mastodon, but it's not working that well...

Fell free to reach out, I'm happy to help!
